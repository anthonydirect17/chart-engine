# ChartBridge protocol v1

ChartBridge is a NinjaTrader 8 add-on. It serves the live chart page at `http://localhost:8765/` and
talks to it over one WebSocket at `ws://localhost:8765/ws`. Everything stays on the local machine.
**Read only:** nothing in this protocol can place, change or cancel an order.

All messages are JSON text. Times:

- `t`: exchange wall-clock seconds stored as if UTC (New York time for CME), fractional for ticks.
  This is the chart-engine convention.
- `u`: real UTC milliseconds since 1970 (used only for delay measurement).

Bars are stamped with their **start** time. NinjaTrader stamps bars at their close; the add-on converts.

## Server to page

| type | fields | when |
|---|---|---|
| `hello` | `version`, `now` (UTC ms), `instruments`: `[{root, name, tick, pointValue}]`, `accounts`: `[name]` | on connect |
| `history` | `root`, `name`, `barSeconds` (60), `bars`: `[[t,o,h,l,c,v], ...]`, `done` (bool) | after `subscribe`, chunked |
| `ticks` | `root`, `ticks`: `[[t,p,v], ...]`, `done` (bool) | after `history`, the current session's trades, chunked |
| `ready` | `root` | history and tick backfill complete; live ticks follow |
| `tick` | `root`, `t`, `u`, `rx` (UTC ms when the add-on received it), `p`, `v` | every trade, live |
| `execs` | `list`: `[exec]` | on connect: executions NinjaTrader already has for today |
| `exec` | `account`, `name` (e.g. `MNQ 12-26`), `root`, `side` (`buy`/`sell`), `qty`, `p`, `t`, `u`, `id`, `order` | each new fill, live |
| `status` | `level` (`info`/`warn`/`error`), `text` | problems worth showing on the page |

## Page to server

| type | fields |
|---|---|
| `subscribe` | `root` (`MNQ`, `NQ`, `MES`, `ES`), `days` (1m history, default 5), `tickHours` (tick backfill cap, default 8) |
| `ping` | `c` (page clock, echoed back in a `pong` with the server clock `s`) |

## Delay readout

For each live tick the page shows two numbers:

- **feed**: `rx - u`, how long the tick took from the exchange timestamp to NinjaTrader (includes
  Tradovate and the PC clock offset from the exchange);
- **local**: page receive time minus `rx`, the add-on to chart hop on this PC.
