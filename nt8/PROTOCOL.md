# ChartBridge protocol (v1 market data and fills, v2 orders)

ChartBridge is a NinjaTrader 8 add-on. It serves the live chart page at `http://localhost:8765/` and
talks to it over one WebSocket at `ws://localhost:8765/ws`. Everything stays on the local machine.
**Read only by default.** Nothing in v1 can place, change or cancel an order. Order entry (v2, ChartBridge
0.3.0 and later) is off unless `config.txt` has `trading = true`; see "Orders (protocol v2)" below.

## Network access (0.3.1)

**This PC only.** Windows' web server under HttpListener (HTTP.sys) listens on every network interface and
matches only the `Host` header, so the prefix `http://localhost:8765/` does not by itself keep other devices
out: on the trading PC (2026-09-29) a request to the Wi-Fi or Tailscale address with a forged
`Host: localhost:8765` was answered, including `/diag`. So ChartBridge checks every request first, on
every path (page files, `/diag`, `/session`, `/ws`), before any routing: the source address must be loopback
(`127.0.0.0/8`, `::1`, or IPv4 loopback mapped into IPv6, `::ffff:127.0.0.1`). Anything else, including a
request whose address cannot be read, gets **403** with no body. A refusal is logged in the Output window once
an hour per address (at most 1000 addresses an hour, so a scan cannot flood it). ChartBridge does not change
HTTP.sys's system-wide listen list (other programs use it).

**Which web pages may read.** A browser always sends an `Origin` header with a WebSocket. The WebSocket at
`/ws` takes a browser only from ChartBridge's own page (`http://localhost:<port>`) or from an origin listed
in `config.txt`:

```
allowOrigins = https://desk.golivepage.com, http://100.88.192.33:8800
```

Each entry is an exact `scheme://host[:port]` (http or https), compared lower-cased; a default port (`:80`,
`:443`) and a trailing slash are dropped, because a browser's `Origin` has neither. No wildcards; an entry with
a path, a `*` or `null` is skipped with a line in the Output window. Any other origin, `Origin: null` (sandboxed
frames, `file://` pages) and an empty `Origin` get **403** before the WebSocket opens. A connection with **no**
`Origin` header is not a browser (a local program such as The Desk's server relay) and is allowed: the address
check already limits it to this PC. Without this, any web site open in the browser could connect to
`ws://localhost:8765/ws` and read account names, fills and CME ticks.

**Trading stays stricter.** An `allowOrigins` page can read the stream but can never sign in or trade: orders
need ChartBridge's own page (gate 4 below, unchanged).

**Never forward anything to 8765.** Do not point any local proxy, tunnel or port forward at port 8765: no
cloudflared ingress, no `tailscale serve` or `tailscale funnel`, no `netsh interface portproxy`, no `ssh -R`, no
local reverse proxy. A forwarded client reaches ChartBridge from the forwarding program on this PC, so it
arrives as 127.0.0.1, and the loopback rule cannot tell it from a local one. Through such a forward, a remote
client could read `/session`, send ChartBridge's own Origin and, with `trading = true`, trade.

**The rules are about other machines and web pages, not local software.** Any program running on this PC can
connect from 127.0.0.1 and send any `Origin` header it likes (including ChartBridge's own), so neither the
loopback rule nor the Origin list is a guard against local software. The Origin list stops web pages open in
a browser (a browser always sends the true Origin); the loopback rule stops other devices. Keep untrusted
programs off the trading PC.

**Second layer.** A Windows firewall rule blocking inbound TCP 8765 is still recommended (admin PowerShell:
`New-NetFirewallRule -DisplayName "ChartBridge 8765 block inbound" -Direction Inbound -Protocol TCP -LocalPort 8765 -Action Block`).
The firewall does not filter traffic within the PC. Safety does not rest on it.

**One-time check on the trading PC** (after installing 0.3.1; from another device, or from the PC itself to its
own Tailscale or LAN address, which is not loopback). Both must print `HTTP/1.1 403` and no body; with the
firewall rule on, a request from another device may simply time out instead, which is also fine:

```
curl -i -H "Host: localhost:8765" http://<tailscale or LAN ip>:8765/diag
curl -i -H "Host: localhost:8765" -H "Connection: Upgrade" -H "Upgrade: websocket" -H "Sec-WebSocket-Version: 13" -H "Sec-WebSocket-Key: dGhlIHNhbXBsZSBub25jZQ==" http://<tailscale or LAN ip>:8765/ws
```

The second one matters most: the WebSocket upgrade cannot be run in the Linux test harness (Mono has no server
WebSocket), so there the order of the checks is only guarded in the source.

`/diag` shows the rules in force under `network`: `loopbackOnly` (true), `allowOrigins` (ChartBridge's own page
first, then the listed ones; not secret), `refusedNotThisPc` and `refusedOrigin` (refusals since the start).

## Messages

All messages are JSON text. Times:

- `t`: exchange wall-clock seconds stored as if UTC (New York time for CME), fractional for ticks.
  This is the chart-engine convention.
- `u`: real UTC milliseconds since 1970 (used only for delay measurement).

Bars are stamped with their **start** time. NinjaTrader stamps bars at their close; the add-on converts.

## Server to page

| type | fields | when |
|---|---|---|
| `hello` | `version`, `now` (UTC ms), `instruments`: `[{root, name, tick, pointValue}]`, `accounts`: `[name]`, `trading` (0.3.0 and later: the `trading` object below, always with `enabled` false until the page signs in) | on connect |
| `history` | `root`, `name`, `barSeconds` (60), `bars`: `[[t,o,h,l,c,v], ...]`, `done` (bool) | after `subscribe`, chunked |
| `ticks` | `root`, `ticks`: `[[t,p,v], ...]`, `done` (bool) | after `history`, the current session's trades, chunked |
| `ready` | `root` | history and tick backfill complete; live ticks follow |
| `tick` | `root`, `t`, `u`, `rx` (UTC ms when the add-on received it), `p`, `v` | every trade, live |
| `execs` | `list`: `[exec]` | on connect: executions NinjaTrader already has for today |
| `exec` | `account`, `name` (e.g. `MNQ 12-26`), `root`, `side` (`buy`/`sell`), `qty`, `p`, `t`, `u`, `id`, `order` | each new fill, live (see Fills below) |
| `status` | `level` (`info`/`warn`/`error`), `text` | problems worth showing on the page |

## Page to server

| type | fields |
|---|---|
| `subscribe` | `root` (`MNQ`, `NQ`, `MES`, `ES`), `days` (1m history, default 5), `tickHours` (tick backfill cap, default 8) |
| `ping` | `c` (page clock, echoed back in a `pong` with the server clock `s`) |

## Delay readout

For each live tick the page shows two numbers:

- **feed**: `rx - u`, how long the tick took from the exchange timestamp to NinjaTrader (includes
  Tradovate and the PC clock offset from the exchange);
- **local**: page receive time minus `rx`, the add-on to chart hop on this PC.

## Fills (0.2.0)

ChartBridge learns about a fill two ways: the account's `ExecutionUpdate` event, and a poll of every
watched account's `Executions` every 2 seconds. Each execution is sent once, keyed by account and
execution id, whichever way sees it first. (Added after the HOME test on 2026-09-29, where no fill
reached ChartBridge; the poll is the fallback, and `/diag` shows which way fills arrive.) A page can
still receive the same `id` twice after a reconnect (in `execs` and later in `exec`); key fills by
`account` and `id`.

Order and position events are counted for `/diag` only. ChartBridge never acts on them.

## Diagnostics: `GET /diag` (this PC only)

JSON: `version`; `network` (0.3.1: see Network access); `clockOffsetMs` (PC clock minus ChartBridge's clock, near 0 once the clock has
re-anchored; the clock is rechecked every 5 seconds and follows the PC clock when they differ by more
than 50 ms); `fillEventsDelivered` and `fillsFoundByPolling` (how many fills came each way this
session); `lastPollUtcMs`; `clients`; `desk` (`postFills`, `deskUrl`, `waiting`, `lastSendFailed`,
`lastError`, `setAside`, `rejectedByDesk`); and `accounts`: one row per watched account with `name`, `connection` (status),
`executions`, `orders`, `positions` (counts NinjaTrader holds) and `fillEvents`, `orderEvents`,
`positionEvents` (events seen). Account names are in this local page; never copy them into reports.

## Fills to The Desk (0.2.0, off by default)

With `postFills = true` in `config.txt`, every fill is also sent to The Desk's `POST /api/fills`
(`deskUrl`, default `http://localhost:8800`) in The Desk's fill shape, with `source` `nt8`. Fills
wait in `pending_fills.jsonl` next to `config.txt` until The Desk accepts them, so a restart or The
Desk being closed loses nothing; The Desk ignores duplicates. A request gives up after 10 seconds; a fill
The Desk refuses as malformed is set aside in `rejected_fills.jsonl` so it never blocks the queue. Fills from every watched account are
sent: The Desk's Accounts menu decides which accounts count. ChartBridge sends no commission (NinjaTrader's
figure is its own commission template, not what was charged).

## Orders (protocol v2, Step 2: trading from the chart)

Decided by Anthony on 2026-09-29: market buy/sell, limit and stop by clicking a price, brackets
(stop and target as an OCO pair), flatten and cancel all; one click while an **Armed** switch is on
(the switch is off after every page load); accounts Sim101 plus Anthony's Lucid evals, named by Anthony
in `config.txt`. Orders go through NinjaTrader's own order system (`Account.Submit` and friends), so
the broker and the prop firm see NinjaTrader orders.

### Safety gates (all enforced in ChartBridge, never only in the page)

1. **Off by default.** Nothing below works unless `config.txt` has `trading = true`.
2. **Account allow-list.** `tradeAccounts = Sim101, <eval names>` in `config.txt`. An order for any
   other account is refused. Backtest and Playback accounts are never allowed. There is no wildcard.
   The account must also be **Connected** in NinjaTrader, and ChartBridge must be listening to its
   order events (it starts listening on the first order if it was not yet).
3. **Size caps on the order and the position.** `maxQty.MNQ = 5` style lines, per instrument root;
   default **1** for any root without a line. No single order may exceed the cap, and the cap limits what
   the position could become: the current position (read two ways, as NinjaTrader lists it and with fills
   it has reported that are not in the position yet, taking the worse, since event order differs between
   connections; a position update consumes only the fills its change explains), plus every order on the same side that may still fill (working, part filled,
   or with a cancel still pending; orders placed in NinjaTrader and bracket legs too; ChartBridge's own
   orders from the moment they are sent; orders that share an OCO id count once, at the largest), plus
   the new order. One order is checked and sent at a time, across all pages. Selling out of a long, or
   buying back a short, is always within the cap.
4. **This page only.** Order messages are accepted only on a WebSocket whose `Origin` header is
   ChartBridge's own page (`http://localhost:<port>`), and only after the page sends the session
   token it read from `GET /session` (served same-origin, no CORS headers, a new random token each
   time ChartBridge starts; `/session` answers only when asked for as `localhost:<port>`, and like every
   path only to this PC). Other web pages, including those in `allowOrigins`, and The Desk, stay read only. Every page
   ChartBridge serves carries `X-Frame-Options: DENY` and `Content-Security-Policy: frame-ancestors
   'none'`, so no other site can show it in a frame and trick a click.
5. **Price and tick checks.** Limit and stop prices must be on the instrument's tick grid and within
   200 ticks of the last price, and that last price must be under 300 seconds old; stop orders must be
   on the right side of the market (a buy stop above, a sell stop below), and so must limits (a buy
   limit at or below the last price, a sell limit at or above: a limit through the market would fill at
   once, which is a market order in disguise). The same checks apply when an order is moved. Refused
   otherwise.
6. **Instruments.** Only the roots ChartBridge serves (`roots`), on the contract it resolved. An order
   on any other contract is never sent to the page and cannot be moved or cancelled from it.
7. **Rate limit.** At most 10 order actions per second per connection; more are refused.
8. **Strict messages.** Only the keys in the table below; anything else (a misspelt `bracket`, a key with
   a space or a dash) is refused, never ignored. `qty` and bracket ticks must be plain JSON whole numbers
   (no quotes, no decimals, no exponent, no leading zero, at most 9 digits); `price` a plain decimal. A
   message with any backslash escape is refused. No key may appear twice. No list
   and no nested object except `bracket`, which must be an object (`"bracket": null` is refused).
   A WebSocket message over 64 KB closes the connection.

A refusal never reaches NinjaTrader; it comes back as `reject` with a plain reason.

### Brackets

A bracket is `{ "stop": ticks, "target": ticks }`, each a whole number from 0 to 200 (0 means none;
both 0 means no bracket). It may only go on an order that opens or adds to a position; on an order
that would reduce the position (by both position readings) it is refused.

- **Placed per fill.** Each time the entry fills (all at once, or in parts), that increment gets its
  own stop and target for exactly that many contracts, priced from that increment's fill price, as an
  OCO pair (`oco` = `cb-<tag>-<filled so far>`). Legs are **GTC**. With only a stop or only a target,
  the lone leg has no OCO id. Legs from an order event are always placed in full, without reading the
  position at fill time (event order differs between connections, so that reading can be stale, and a
  withheld stop is the worst outcome). If a fill turns out to have closed an opposite position (for
  example a bracketed sell limit that fills after Anthony went long elsewhere), the legs check below
  removes the legs from the wrong side once the position has settled.
- **Stop level already passed.** If the stop price has already traded when the fill is reported (a
  fast market, a late event), and ChartBridge has a trade price from the last 2 seconds to prove it,
  ChartBridge sends a market exit for that increment instead of a stop through the market (which a
  broker rejects, and a rejected leg can take its OCO partner with it), and raises a `status` `error`.
  A rejected market exit raises a `status` `error` too ("the position may have NO STOP").
- **Named for recovery.** The entry's order name carries the bracket (`CB#1a2b3c4d s8 t16`), and each
  leg's name carries its fill increment: `CB#1a2b3c4d stop f2 q2 p24990.25` (the pair for the fill that
  brought the entry to 2 filled, 2 contracts, filled at 24990.25); a market exit is
  `CB#1a2b3c4d exit f2 q2 p24990.25`. After a recompile or restart of ChartBridge the bracket is rebuilt
  from these names (covered contracts, their prices, and the working pairs), so later fills still get
  legs at their own price and earlier ones do not get a second set.
- **Nothing missed while stopped.** Any NinjaScript compile reloads the add-on, and an entry that fills
  meanwhile sends no further update. Every 2 seconds (and at start) every ChartBridge entry with fills
  is checked; a fill without legs that has stayed that way for 4 seconds (so an order event still on its
  way is never raced) gets legs for the contracts the settled position holds in the entry's direction
  beyond what ChartBridge's other legs cover, with a `status` `warn`. Never twice.
- **A stop that goes missing is loud.** For any contract ChartBridge has put legs on (remembered across
  reloads from the working legs), whatever direction the position now has, if the working ChartBridge
  stops on the closing side cover fewer contracts than the position holds for 4 seconds (a stop rejected
  or cancelled by hand, contracts added without a bracket, or a leg that filled and left a position of
  its own), the page gets a `status` `error`, once per situation and again if it happens on a later trade.
  When the stop was cancelled or rejected and NinjaTrader's OCO cancelled its target too (0.3.1, from the
  Sim101 test), the text says so: "... working stops cover 0 contract(s); the target was cancelled too (OCO),
  so the position has no stop and no target; check NinjaTrader and add a stop". The start of the text is
  unchanged. Pairs ChartBridge cancels itself (Flatten, a flat position, the legs check) are not called lost;
  after a reload only pairs lost since then are known.
  A market exit that is rejected or cancelled raises an error too.
- **Reconnects.** The scan never decides "no legs needed" while the account's connection is not steady
  (a reconnect can list orders before positions); it places what the listed position shows and looks
  again later.
- **Partner follows.** When one leg fills in part, its partner is shrunk to what is still open; when
  one fills in full, its partner is cancelled.
- **Never opens a position.** When the position goes flat (and is still flat when checked, on a
  connection that has been up for 30 seconds), ChartBridge's working legs on that contract that are more
  than 3 seconds old are cancelled, with a `status` `warn` (younger legs may belong to a new entry whose
  position change has not landed yet; the legs check handles them). Every 2 seconds a check compares
  ChartBridge's legs with the position: legs on a flat or opposite position are cancelled, and legs
  covering more contracts than the position are shrunk, newest first. It acts only when the same
  position and legs have held for 4 seconds and the account has been Connected for 30 seconds without a
  break (a reconnect can show orders before positions; a NinjaTrader connection status change starts
  the 30 seconds again for the accounts on that connection, so a drop between two samples is not
  missed, while a price-feed-only status event changes nothing), and says so with a `status` `warn`. Orders not named `CB#` are never touched by it.
- **A late fill after Flatten is protected.** If an entry fills after `flatten` (its cancel lost the
  race), it still gets its stop and target, and a `status` `error` says a position may be open.
- **Upkeep never stops.** Bracket upkeep runs even if `trading` is switched off, so a position placed
  from the chart keeps its legs.
- **Problems are loud.** A leg that NinjaTrader rejects raises a `status` `error` ("the position may have
  NO STOP") and is logged in NinjaTrader's Output window.

Stop-limit orders are shown but can only be moved in NinjaTrader.

### Signing in

1. `GET /session` (same origin, no CORS headers) answers `{"token": "<48 hex characters>", "trading": true|false}`.
   The token is new each time ChartBridge starts.
2. After `hello`, the page sends `{"type":"auth","token":"..."}` on the WebSocket and gets a `trading`
   message back; when `enabled` is true, `orders` and one `position` per open position follow.
3. A page that is shown inside a frame should not sign in (ChartBridge's headers already stop other
   sites from framing it).

### Page to server

| type | fields (no others are accepted) | notes |
|---|---|---|
| `auth` | `token` | once per connection, after `hello`. Answer: `trading` (below). |
| `order` | `cid` (page id, string, optional), `account`, `root`, `side` (`buy`/`sell`), `kind` (`market`/`limit`/`stop`), `qty`, `price` (limit/stop only; a market order with a price is refused), `bracket` (optional, see Brackets) | |
| `change` | `cid` (optional), `id` (ChartBridge order id, `o1`, `o2`, ...), `price` | move a working limit or stop, or a bracket leg (drag on the chart) |
| `cancel` | `cid` (optional), `id` | cancel one working order (cancelling one leg of an OCO pair cancels its partner) |
| `flatten` | `cid` (optional), `account`, `root` | cancel every working order for that account and instrument, then close the position at market |

String values must be plain (no backslash escapes, at most 200 characters).

### Server to page

| type | fields | when |
|---|---|---|
| `trading` | `enabled` (bool), `reason` (when not enabled), `accounts` (allowed names), `maxQty` (`{root: n}`, including the default under `"*"`) | answer to `auth`; also in `hello` with `enabled` false until `auth` succeeds |
| `orders` | `list`: `[order]` | after `auth`, every working order on the allowed accounts |
| `order` | `id` (ChartBridge's id, stable while the order lives), `cid` (when placed from this page), `account`, `root`, `name`, `side`, `kind` (`market`, `limit`, `stop`, `stopLimit`, `other`), `qty`, `filled`, `price` (limit or stop price, or null), `avgFill` (or null), `state` (`working`, `partFilled`, `filled`, `cancelled`, `cancelling`, `rejected`), `role` (`entry`, `stop`, `target`, or `other` for orders placed elsewhere), `oco` (or null), `text` (NinjaTrader's error when rejected or failed) | every order change, live |
| `position` | `account`, `root`, `qty` (signed: long positive, short negative), `avgPrice` (or null when flat) | after `auth` and on every change |
| `reject` | `cid` or `id` (whichever the message had), `reason` | a refusal by ChartBridge's gates |
| `status` | `level` `error` (a bracket leg rejected or a bracket error: check the stop now) or `warn` (the legs check cancelled or shrank legs), `text` | bracket problems, to signed-in pages |

Orders placed in NinjaTrader itself (or anywhere else) on an allowed account also show on the chart,
with `role` `other`, and can be moved or cancelled from the chart.
