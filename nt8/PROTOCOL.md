# ChartBridge protocol v1

ChartBridge is a NinjaTrader 8 add-on. It serves the live chart page at `http://localhost:8765/` and
talks to it over one WebSocket at `ws://localhost:8765/ws`. Everything stays on the local machine.
**Read only:** nothing in this protocol can place, change or cancel an order.

All messages are JSON text. Times:

- `t`: exchange wall-clock seconds stored as if UTC (New York time for CME), fractional for ticks.
  This is the chart-engine convention.
- `u`: real UTC milliseconds since 1970 (used only for delay measurement).

Bars are stamped with their **start** time. NinjaTrader stamps bars at their close; the add-on converts.

## Server to page

| type | fields | when |
|---|---|---|
| `hello` | `version`, `now` (UTC ms), `instruments`: `[{root, name, tick, pointValue}]`, `accounts`: `[name]` | on connect |
| `history` | `root`, `name`, `barSeconds` (60), `bars`: `[[t,o,h,l,c,v], ...]`, `done` (bool) | after `subscribe`, chunked |
| `ticks` | `root`, `ticks`: `[[t,p,v], ...]`, `done` (bool) | after `history`, the current session's trades, chunked |
| `ready` | `root` | history and tick backfill complete; live ticks follow |
| `tick` | `root`, `t`, `u`, `rx` (UTC ms when the add-on received it), `p`, `v` | every trade, live |
| `execs` | `list`: `[exec]` | on connect: executions NinjaTrader already has for today |
| `exec` | `account`, `name` (e.g. `MNQ 12-26`), `root`, `side` (`buy`/`sell`), `qty`, `p`, `t`, `u`, `id`, `order` | each new fill, live (see Fills below) |
| `status` | `level` (`info`/`warn`/`error`), `text` | problems worth showing on the page |

## Page to server

| type | fields |
|---|---|
| `subscribe` | `root` (`MNQ`, `NQ`, `MES`, `ES`), `days` (1m history, default 5), `tickHours` (tick backfill cap, default 8) |
| `ping` | `c` (page clock, echoed back in a `pong` with the server clock `s`) |

## Delay readout

For each live tick the page shows two numbers:

- **feed**: `rx - u`, how long the tick took from the exchange timestamp to NinjaTrader (includes
  Tradovate and the PC clock offset from the exchange);
- **local**: page receive time minus `rx`, the add-on to chart hop on this PC.

## Fills (0.2.0)

ChartBridge learns about a fill two ways: the account's `ExecutionUpdate` event, and a poll of every
watched account's `Executions` every 2 seconds. Each execution is sent once, keyed by account and
execution id, whichever way sees it first. (Added after the HOME test on 2026-09-29, where no fill
reached ChartBridge; the poll is the fallback, and `/diag` shows which way fills arrive.) A page can
still receive the same `id` twice after a reconnect (in `execs` and later in `exec`); key fills by
`account` and `id`.

Order and position events are counted for `/diag` only. ChartBridge never acts on them.

## Diagnostics: `GET /diag` (this PC only)

JSON: `version`; `clockOffsetMs` (PC clock minus ChartBridge's clock, near 0 once the clock has
re-anchored; the clock is rechecked every 5 seconds and follows the PC clock when they differ by more
than 50 ms); `fillEventsDelivered` and `fillsFoundByPolling` (how many fills came each way this
session); `lastPollUtcMs`; `clients`; `desk` (`postFills`, `deskUrl`, `waiting`, `lastSendFailed`,
`lastError`, `setAside`, `rejectedByDesk`); and `accounts`: one row per watched account with `name`, `connection` (status),
`executions`, `orders`, `positions` (counts NinjaTrader holds) and `fillEvents`, `orderEvents`,
`positionEvents` (events seen). Account names are in this local page; never copy them into reports.

## Fills to The Desk (0.2.0, off by default)

With `postFills = true` in `config.txt`, every fill is also sent to The Desk's `POST /api/fills`
(`deskUrl`, default `http://localhost:8800`) in The Desk's fill shape, with `source` `nt8`. Fills
wait in `pending_fills.jsonl` next to `config.txt` until The Desk accepts them, so a restart or The
Desk being closed loses nothing; The Desk ignores duplicates. A request gives up after 10 seconds; a fill
The Desk refuses as malformed is set aside in `rejected_fills.jsonl` so it never blocks the queue. Fills from every watched account are
sent: The Desk's Accounts menu decides which accounts count. ChartBridge sends no commission (NinjaTrader's
figure is its own commission template, not what was charged).

## Orders (protocol v2, Step 2: trading from the chart)

Decided by Anthony on 2026-09-29: market buy/sell, limit and stop by clicking a price, brackets
(stop and target as an OCO pair), flatten and cancel all; one click while an **Armed** switch is on
(the switch is off after every page load); accounts Sim101 plus Anthony's Lucid evals, named by Anthony
in `config.txt`. Orders go through NinjaTrader's own order system (`Account.Submit` and friends), so
the broker and the prop firm see NinjaTrader orders.

### Safety gates (all enforced in ChartBridge, never only in the page)

1. **Off by default.** Nothing below works unless `config.txt` has `trading = true`.
2. **Account allow-list.** `tradeAccounts = Sim101, <eval names>` in `config.txt`. An order for any
   other account is refused. Backtest and Playback accounts are never allowed. There is no wildcard.
   The account must also be **Connected** in NinjaTrader, and ChartBridge must be listening to its
   order events (it starts listening on the first order if it was not yet).
3. **Size caps on the position.** `maxQty.MNQ = 5` style lines, per instrument root; default **1** for
   any root without a line. The cap limits what the position could become: the current position, plus
   every working order on the same side (orders placed in NinjaTrader and bracket legs too; orders that
   share an OCO id count once, at the largest), plus the new order. Selling out of a long, or buying
   back a short, is always within the cap.
4. **This page only.** Order messages are accepted only on a WebSocket whose `Origin` header is
   ChartBridge's own page (`http://localhost:<port>`), and only after the page sends the session
   token it read from `GET /session` (served same-origin, no CORS headers, a new random token each
   time ChartBridge starts). Other web pages in the browser, and The Desk, stay read only. Every page
   ChartBridge serves carries `X-Frame-Options: DENY` and `Content-Security-Policy: frame-ancestors
   'none'`, so no other site can show it in a frame and trick a click.
5. **Price and tick checks.** Limit and stop prices must be on the instrument's tick grid and within
   200 ticks of the last price, and that last price must be under 300 seconds old; stop orders must be
   on the right side of the market (a buy stop above, a sell stop below). Refused otherwise.
6. **Instruments.** Only the roots ChartBridge serves (`roots`), on the contract it resolved. An order
   on any other contract is never sent to the page and cannot be moved or cancelled from it.
7. **Rate limit.** At most 10 order actions per second per connection; more are refused.
8. **Strict messages.** Only the keys in the table below; anything else (a misspelt `bracket`, say) is
   refused, never ignored. `qty` and bracket ticks must be plain JSON whole numbers (no quotes, no
   decimals, no exponent, at most 9 digits); `price` a plain decimal. No key may appear twice. No list
   and no nested object except `bracket`, which must be an object (`"bracket": null` is refused).
   A WebSocket message over 64 KB closes the connection.

A refusal never reaches NinjaTrader; it comes back as `reject` with a plain reason.

### Brackets

A bracket is `{ "stop": ticks, "target": ticks }`, each a whole number from 0 to 200 (0 means none;
both 0 means no bracket). It may only go on an order that opens or adds to a position; on an order
that would reduce the position it is refused.

- **Placed per fill.** Each time the entry fills (all at once, or in parts), that increment gets its
  own stop and target for exactly that many contracts, priced from that increment's fill price, as an
  OCO pair (`oco` = `cb-<tag>-<filled so far>`). Legs are **GTC**. With only a stop or only a target,
  the lone leg has no OCO id.
- **Named for recovery.** The entry's order name carries the bracket (`CB#1a2b3c4d s8 t16`), and legs
  are named `CB#1a2b3c4d stop` and `CB#1a2b3c4d target`. After a recompile or restart of ChartBridge
  the bracket is rebuilt from these names, so later fills still get legs and earlier ones do not get
  a second set.
- **Partner follows.** When one leg fills in part, its partner is shrunk to what is still open; when
  one fills in full, its partner is cancelled.
- **Never opens a position.** When the position goes flat (and is still flat when checked, on a
  connection that has been up for 30 seconds), ChartBridge's working legs on that contract are
  cancelled. Every 2 seconds a check compares ChartBridge's legs with the position: legs on a flat or
  opposite position are cancelled, and legs covering more contracts than the position are shrunk,
  newest first. It acts only when the same position and legs have held for 4 seconds and the account
  has been Connected for 30 seconds (a reconnect can show orders before positions), and says so with a
  `status` `warn`. Orders not named `CB#` are never touched by it.
- **Flatten wins.** After `flatten`, an entry that still fills late gets no new legs.
- **Upkeep never stops.** Bracket upkeep runs even if `trading` is switched off, so a position placed
  from the chart keeps its legs.
- **Problems are loud.** A leg that NinjaTrader rejects raises a `status` `error` ("the position may have
  NO STOP") and is logged in NinjaTrader's Output window.

Stop-limit orders are shown but can only be moved in NinjaTrader.

### Page to server

### Server to page

| type | fields | when |
|---|---|---|
| `trading` | `enabled` (bool), `reason` (when not enabled), `accounts` (allowed names), `maxQty` (`{root: n}`, including the default under `"*"`) | answer to `auth`; also in `hello` with `enabled` false until `auth` succeeds |
| `orders` | `list`: `[order]` | after `auth`, every working order on the allowed accounts |
| `order` | `id` (ChartBridge's id, stable while the order lives), `cid` (when placed from this page), `account`, `root`, `name`, `side`, `kind` (`market`, `limit`, `stop`, `stopLimit`, `other`), `qty`, `filled`, `price` (limit or stop price, or null), `avgFill` (or null), `state` (`working`, `partFilled`, `filled`, `cancelled`, `cancelling`, `rejected`), `role` (`entry`, `stop`, `target`, or `other` for orders placed elsewhere), `oco` (or null), `text` (NinjaTrader's error when rejected or failed) | every order change, live |
| `position` | `account`, `root`, `qty` (signed: long positive, short negative), `avgPrice` (or null when flat) | after `auth` and on every change |
| `reject` | `cid` or `id` (whichever the message had), `reason` | a refusal by ChartBridge's gates |
| `status` | `level` `error` (a bracket leg rejected or a bracket error: check the stop now) or `warn` (the legs check cancelled or shrank legs), `text` | bracket problems, to signed-in pages |

Orders placed in NinjaTrader itself (or anywhere else) on an allowed account also show on the chart,
with `role` `other`, and can be moved or cancelled from the chart.
