# Changelog

## 1.0.0 (2026-09-29)

First release, extracted from the Chart lab prototype (v0) that Anthony approved on 2026-09-29
("that is such a fantastic chart. Thats what I want to actually trade on").

- The Custom engine from Chart lab, now a reusable module with a public API (`create`, `setBars`,
  `update`, `setLevels`, `setTrades`, `setLayers`, `setTheme`, events). Motion, layout and drawing
  are unchanged from the approved lab.
- Candles default to Carolina blue (bull) and deep purple (bear), per Anthony.
- New Colors panel (`mountThemePanel`): presets, bull / bear / VWAP pickers, saved per browser.
- Trade marks now use the house trade colors: entry by side (green long, red short), connector and
  chip by result (green profit, red loss), so they never depend on the candle colors.
- Text in candle colors (legend change, tags) is lightened or flipped automatically to stay readable.
- Sessions and regular hours are configurable, including 24/7 markets; daily bars get month and date
  labels, for the crypto mid-term charts.
- Lightweight Charts and the engine switch are gone; the lab comparison is decided.
- Unit tests (Node) and a Chromium smoke test.
